My portfolio

This is the html and css code for my portfolio website. It has an interactive design giving direct feedback to the user. There's some info about me, some of the projects i've been working on and some contact info.

It uses html and css. Css is used alot to make the style stand out and make the design responsive.

This is a project in the works so there is much more to come, for example adding images and links to all my projects and writing all the info text (and maybe change some of the design).
