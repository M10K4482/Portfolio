My portfolio

This is a website for my portfolio. It has an interactive design giving direct feedback to the user by the means of bells and whistles
to make it seem all the more compelling. Here you can view some info about me, some of the projects i've been working on and some contact info.

It uses html and css. The css is used alot for making its styling stand out and make the design responsive.

This is a project in the works so there is much more to come, for example adding images and links to all my projects and writing all the info text (and maybe change some of the design).
